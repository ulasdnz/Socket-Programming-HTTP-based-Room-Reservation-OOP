<hr>
</div>

In this project, we are usin Object Oriented Programming (OOP) methodology to implement an HTTP server that acts as a room reservation server. We only use tcp socket to create this http server. We can create activities and rooms and then reserve the room for an activity for the specified hours of the specified day. We use json files as our databases. More details about the project can be found in the Assignment pdf file.

## Usage

* Open three different terminal.
* For each folder (activity, room, reservation), run app.js via command "node app.js".
